# Excitr Project
The aim of this app is to create a platform for people to meet and connect with each other. 

## App Description
Xciter is a new and slightly more meaningful app that will give individuals the opportunity to reach out to new people they find interesting or who share the same interests as themselves. The concept is inspired from some of the classic dating apps, however it takes it a step further by giving people the opportunity to create a network of new connections.

The app requires the user to sign up with a username, an email or number, and a password. From here the user must create a profile with their name, age, a picture of themselves, a list of interest and a bio. The bio is an opportunity for the user to share more information about themselves that goes beyond generic interests. 

When the profile is created, the user can move to the “meet”-page where she will be presented to two new people through their profile “cards”. These cards presents the user to the other two users' profiles, and she must choose which one of these two she likes best. The one she liked will remain on the page and she will be presented with a new card. Again she has to choose which person she likes the best. If she likes the same person over the other three times then a match is created. On another window in the app the user has the opportunity to get the match´s contact information and they have the chance to connect and meet in real life. 

Because the users have to like a person over someone else three times it adds some legitimacy to the connection. One can be more certain that there is a mutual interest between users when they use Excitr. However one will naturally be interested in more than one person. On the app there will be an overview of all the matches one has made, so that the user can easily go back and find the contact information to all of the people you matched with. 


## User Story
After a year and a half living in a global pandemic, Ulf Reidar has recognized an increased need to connect with new people. He finds that he does not have a platform where he can get in touch with people with the same interests as him without being forced to meet more people than he is comfortable with. Ulf wants an app or webpage where he can find a meaningful connection that goes beyond just swiping on people left and right. He wants to find a new friend, girlfriend or companion who has some of the same interests as he does, like camping and knitting by the fire. And he wants to be certain that there is almost a guaranteed mutual interest between him and this new person. After being “introduced” he wants to be able to get in touch and meet this person in real life. Being comfortable that it is safe also from a pandemic viewpoint.

## Illustration
Below are three figma frames roughly describing how the application is going to look like after it is finished. 

1. First the user is presented with two profile cards, where only the profile picture, the name and the age is displayed. In the top left corner is a small profile picture of the user. If this is pressed the user will be directed to their profile where they can edit their information, pictures, preferences, etc. The xcitr-icon in the bottom left corner can be pressed to get an overview of all the people the user has matched with.

2. When the user likes one of the profiles more than the other, she swipes the card upwards. Here you can see that there is a counter 1/3 describing how many times the user has liked this persons profile. When this ever reaches 3/3 there will be a match.

3. After swiping to tell the application which profile is the preferred one, this card will fall back onto the screen together with a new profile. The user can now compare the person they have already liked to a new profile and see if this person is the most likable. If the user is unsure on which profile she prefers, then she can press the profile card and view the profiles bio.
