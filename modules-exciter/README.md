# Xcitr Project
The aim of this app is to create a platform for people to meet and connect with each other. 

## App Description
Xcitr is a new and slightly more meaningful app that will give individuals the opportunity to reach out to new people they find interesting or who share the same interests as themselves. The concept is inspired from some of the classic dating apps, however it takes it a step further by giving people the opportunity to create a network of new more meaningful connections.

The app requires the user to sign up with their name, age, an email and a password. From here the user can expand their profile with a picture of themselves and a bio. The bio is an opportunity for the user to share more information about themselves that goes beyond generic interests. 

When the account is created, the user moves to the “meet”-page where she will be presented with two new people through their profile “cards”. These cards presents the name, age and picture of two other accounts on the app. The user must now choose which one of these two she likes best, or if she doesn't like any of them she will be able to refresh the match page so that she can be presented with two new people. When the user has decided which person she prefers she "discards" or swipes away the one she likes the least. The one the user preferred will remain on the page and she will be presented with a new person. Again she has to choose which person she likes the best. If she likes the same person over the other three times then a "proper" like to that person is registered. If that person has liked the user over someone else three times also, there will be a match. On another page in the app the user has the opportunity to see an overview of her matches, as well as their contact information. From here on they have the chance to connect and meet in real life. 

Because the users have to like a person over someone else three times it adds some legitimacy to the connection. One can be more certain that there is a mutual interest between users when they use Xcitr. However one will naturally be interested in more than one person. On the app there will be an overview of all the matches one has made, so that the user can easily go back and find the contact information to all of the people you matched with. 


## User Stories
### Story 1 - Clive
As a user Clive wants to be able to match with multiple people he finds interesting and then be able to see an overview of his matches with contact information so that he can get in touch with them and potentially meet up with them. As a user he also wants to compare people and like them multiple times before a match occurs, so that he is sure he likes the girls he matches with and that they like him back. This is because Clive ended a two year relationship three months ago because his girlfriend was a cheating on him. He wants to meet a lot of new people to try and move on, but also to have some proper fun. As a 23 year old math major, school takes up a lot of time. This makes it hard to meet people during his free time, which the last few months have been dedicated to the gym. Clive wants a platform or arena where he can easily get in touch with a bunch of new people so he can forget his ex. However he wants there to be a guarantee that there is a mutual interest between him and a potential rebound. He is noticing that he has developed some trust issues and a new real-life rejection would be very painful.

### Story 2 - Michelle
As a user Michelle wants to be able to match with both girls and guys, but also to be able to refresh the people she are presented with so that she only matches with people who have the same party interest as her. Partying is one of Michelles favourite past-times. She is a 21 year old who spends her days working at a vintage shop, while she figures out what she wants to do with her life. While she has the money and time to go out most days of the week, her friends are not always as excited to go to the bars on a tuesday or to host parties at their houses on random thursdays. Michelle wants an app where she can meet other party-people around her own age who also wants to go out on the odd days during the week. She wants the application to put her in touch with both guys and gals (not just one or the other), as long as she has the oppertunity to see how old they are. She would prefer not to suddenly go out with a 40 year old man. She also needs to make sure that the people she gets in touch with actually likes to party, either she needs to view it on their profile or through getting in touch with them. 

### Story 3 - Mia
As a user Mia wants to be able to see peoples ages and their bio so that she can meet up with people her own age who have expressed an interested for knitting. Also, because she finds smartphone technology quite challenging Mia would prefer to get her matches´ phone number or email so she can communicate with them on these channels instead of a potential chat function on the app. Mia is a swedish, 83 year old pensioner who recently got a new granddaughter. She loves her granddaughter more than anything and wants to knit a body for her, just like the one her grandmother knitted for her when she was a newborn many years ago. Mia enjoys knitting but is not so good at it. She also thinks knitting is a great way to be social and meet some new people. Mia wants to take use of her new smartphone to get in touch with someone who can help her with her knitting project and maybe become a new friend. 

## Illustration
Below are five figma frames roughly describing how the application is going to look like after it is finished. 

1. Firstly, because the application is user based, they need to login or create an account before they get access to use Xcitr. The two images below describes the design of the login and signup page. Here they need an email and password to login. If one does not have an account the blue signup text can be pressed to move to the signup window where one can create a user with a name, age, email and password.

2. When the user is logged in or an account has been created they move on to the match page. Here the user is presented to two profile cards, where the users profile picture, name and age are displayed. In the top right corner is a small profile picture of the user. If this button is pressed the user will be directed to their profile where they can edit their information, pictures, preferences, etc. The Xcitr-icon in the bottom right corner can be pressed to get an overview of all the people the user has matched with.

2. When the user likes one of the profiles more than the other, they swipe the card upwards. Here you can see that there is a counter 1/3 describing how many times the user has liked this persons profile. If the user likes someone 3/3 times the card will move to the left and a potenital match may occur.

3. After swiping to tell the application which profile is the preferred one, this card will fall back onto the screen together with a new profile. The user can now compare the person they have already liked to a new profile and see if this person is the most likable. If the user is unsure on which profile they prefer, they can press the refresh button to get two new users they can compare.
