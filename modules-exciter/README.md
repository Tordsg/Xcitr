# The Xcitr Project

The aim of Xcitr is to provide people with a new platform for meeting new people. If you´re looking to expand your social network, make a new meaningful connection or just live in the present, then Xcitr is the perfect wingman or wingwoman for you.

## App Description

Xcitr is a new and slightly more meaningful app that will give individuals the opportunity to reach out to new people they find interesting or who share the same interests as themselves. The concept is inspired from some of the classic dating apps, however it takes it a step further by giving people the opportunity to create a network of new more meaningful connections.

The app requires the user to sign up with their name, age, an email and a password. From here the user can expand their profile by choosing an avatar and writing a bio. The bio is an opportunity for the user to share more information about themselves that goes beyond generic interests.

When the account is created, the user moves to the swiping-page where she will be presented with two new people through their profile “cards”. These cards presents the name, age and picture of two other accounts on the app. The user must now choose which one of these two she likes best, or if she doesn't like any of them she will be able to refresh the swiping page so that she can be presented with two new people. When the user has decided which person she prefers she "discards" or swipes away the one she likes the least. The one the user preferred will remain on the page and she will be presented with a new person. Again she has to choose which person she likes the best. If she likes the same person over the other three times then a "proper" like to that person is registered. If that person has liked the user over someone else three times also, there will be a match. On another page in the app the user has the opportunity to see an overview of her matches, as well as their contact information. From here on they have the chance to connect and meet in real life.

Because the users have to like a person over someone else three times it adds some legitimacy to the connection. One can be more certain that there is a mutual interest between users when they use Xcitr. However one will naturally be interested in more than one person. On the app there will be an overview of all the matches one has made, so that the user can easily go back and find the contact information to all of the people you matched with.

The application has been developed based on 9 different userstories, that are outlined and summerized in [userstories.md](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/groups-2021/gr2117/gr2117/-/tree/master/userstories.md). The requirements set by the users for the user interface and functionality are outlined in the app illustration below:
