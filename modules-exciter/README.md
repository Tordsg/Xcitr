# Xcitr Project
The aim of this app is to create a platform for people to meet and connect with each other. 

## App Description
Xcitr is a new and slightly more meaningful app that will give individuals the opportunity to reach out to new people they find interesting or who share the same interests as themselves. The concept is inspired from some of the classic dating apps, however it takes it a step further by giving people the opportunity to create a network of new connections.

The app requires the user to sign up with a username, an email or number, and a password. From here the user must create a profile with their name, age, a picture of themselves, a list of interest and a bio. The bio is an opportunity for the user to share more information about themselves that goes beyond generic interests. 

When the profile is created, the user can move to the “meet”-page where she will be presented to two new people through their profile “cards”. These cards presents the user to the other two users' profiles, and she must choose which one of these two she likes best. The one she liked will remain on the page and she will be presented with a new card. Again she has to choose which person she likes the best. If she likes the same person over the other three times then a match is created. On another window in the app the user has the opportunity to get the match´s contact information and they have the chance to connect and meet in real life. 

Because the users have to like a person over someone else three times it adds some legitimacy to the connection. One can be more certain that there is a mutual interest between users when they use Xcitr. However one will naturally be interested in more than one person. On the app there will be an overview of all the matches one has made, so that the user can easily go back and find the contact information to all of the people you matched with. 


## User Stories
### Story 1 - Clive
Clive ended a two year relationship three months ago because his girlfriend was a cheating on him. He wants to meet a lot of new people to try and move on, but also to have some proper fun. As a 23 year old math major, school takes up a lot of time. This makes it hard to meet people during his free time, which the last few months have been dedicated to the gym. Clive wants a platform or arena where he can easily get in touch with a bunch of new people so he can forget his ex. However he wants there to be a guarantee that there is a mutual interest between him and a potential rebound. He is noticing that he has developed some trust issues and a new real-life rejection would be very painful. Because of this he also wants a way to get in touch with each person more directly than just through the app, for example by number or mail. 

### Story 2 - Michelle
Partying is one of Michelles favourite past-times. She is a 21 year old who spends her days working at a vintage shop, while she figures out what she wants to do with her life. While she has the money and time to go out most days of the week, her friends are not always as excited to go to the bars on a tuesday or to host parties at their houses on random thursdays. Michelle wants an app where she can meet other party-people around her own age who also wants to go out on the odd days during the week. She wants the application to put her in touch with both guys and gals (not just one or the other), as long as she has the oppertunity to see how old they are. She would prefer not to suddenly go out with a 40 year old man. She also needs to make sure that the people she gets in touch with actually likes to party, either she needs to view it on their profile or through getting in touch with them. 

### Story 3 - Mia
Mia is a swedish, 83 year old pensioner who recently got a new granddaughter. She loves her granddaughter more than anything and wants to knit a body for her, just like the one her grandmother knitted for her when she was a newborn many years ago. Mia enjoys knitting but is not so good at it. She also thinks knitting is a great way to be social and meet some new people. Mia wants to take use of her new smartphone to get in touch with someone who can help her with her knitting project and maybe become a new friend. She needs to be able to contact the ones she gets in touch with, as well as to be able to compare peoples skills and personalities. 

## Illustration
Below are three figma frames roughly describing how the application is going to look like after it is finished. 

1. First the user is presented with two profile cards, where only the profile picture, the name and the age is displayed. In the top right corner is a small profile picture of the user. If this is pressed the user will be directed to their profile where they can edit their information, pictures, preferences, etc. The Xcitr-icon in the bottom right corner can be pressed to get an overview of all the people the user has matched with.

2. When the user likes one of the profiles more than the other, she swipes the card upwards. Here you can see that there is a counter 1/3 describing how many times the user has liked this persons profile. When this ever reaches 3/3 there will be a match.

3. After swiping to tell the application which profile is the preferred one, this card will fall back onto the screen together with a new profile. The user can now compare the person they have already liked to a new profile and see if this person is the most likable. If the user is unsure on which profile she prefers, then she can press the profile card and view the profiles bio.

Not all of the functionalities in the app, like having profile pictures for the users, is functional i gitpod. However when running the app in vscode or locally on the computer it works.
